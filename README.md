# Flutter Learning Journey

Welcome to my Flutter Learning Journey repository! This repository documents my progress and learning experience with Flutter, featuring various widgets I've created and simple projects I built during my learning path.

## [Widgets](widgets/)

- This folder contains custom Flutter widgets that I have learned and experimented with. 
- Each widget is like a separate piece that shows a specific feature or function in Flutter.


## Projects
1. **[Simple Project 01](flutter_simple_project_01)**:  Application that displays a centered text in the AppBar and an image in the body.
2. **[Simple Project 02](flutter_simple_project_02)**:  Application that displays a "To Do" title in the app bar and a "Hello, Yousef" message in the center of the screen.
3. **[My Card 03](my_card_03)**: Application that displays a personal profile card with contact information.
4. **[Row and Column practical 04](flutter_row_and_column_practical_04)**: Application that displays ascrollable layout containing text inside containers, arranged in rows and columns.


For more details on each project, browse the respective folders.
